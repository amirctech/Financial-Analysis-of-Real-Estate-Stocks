# Financial-Analysis-of-Real-Estate-Stocks

## Description
In this project, we created a financial analytics dashboard via Streamlit that presented 3 different real estate ETF portfolios in which anyone could invest through Ethereum.
We selected an ETF from 3 different sectors which included XLRE(Residential), ICF(Commercial) and CORN(Agriculture).
The dashboard provides a brief selection of critical metrics that are useful in deciding whether the selected ETF is worth investing in.
