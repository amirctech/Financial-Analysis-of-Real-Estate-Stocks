## Description

The Financial Analysis in Real Estate Stocks project is dedicated to delivering comprehensive insights and investment opportunities in the real estate market. The project revolves around the computation of algorithmic returns for three carefully chosen real estate stocks, each representing a distinct sector: agriculture, commercial, and housing. This initiative combines data-driven analysis, machine learning, and blockchain technology to empower investors with valuable tools and information.

**Key Project Highlights:**

-  **Stock Selection and Data Retrieval:** Our team diligently researched and identified the top-performing real estate stocks within the agriculture, commercial, and housing industries. To facilitate accurate analysis, we sourced historical stock data through Alpaca APIs, ensuring a reliable foundation for our calculations.

-  **Machine Learning for Buy/Sell Signals:** Leveraging advanced machine learning models, including Logistic Regression and Single Moving Averages, we aimed for precision, accuracy, and a high F1 score in the confusion matrix. This enabled us to establish clear buy/sell signals, providing users with valuable insights for investment decisions.

- **Algorithmic Returns Analysis:** With robust buy/sell signals in place, our team computed algorithmic returns for each of the selected real estate stocks. Our objective was to surpass the performance of actual returns, offering investors a competitive advantage in their portfolios.

- **Portfolio Evaluation Metrics:** To ensure that users can make informed investment decisions, we calculated a range of portfolio evaluation metrics. These metrics encompass annualized return, cumulative returns, annual volatility, Sharpe ratio, and Sortino ratio, providing a comprehensive view of each real estate stock's performance.

- **Cryptocurrency Integration:** As an extension of traditional investment avenues, we embraced the world of blockchain technology. Our team created a secure cryptocurrency wallet using Web3, opening up the possibility for users to invest in real estate stocks via Ethereum.

- **Streamlined User Experience:** The project culminated in the development of an intuitive Streamlit app. This user-friendly platform empowers investors to effortlessly select real estate stocks, visualize returns, and execute investmentsâ€”all while harnessing the power of cryptocurrency.

**Project Goal:**
Our tool is designed to empower users with the ability to perform financial analysis on real estate stocks and visualize investment opportunities. By seamlessly integrating cryptocurrency into the investment process, we aim to provide a cutting-edge platform for informed decision-making in the dynamic world of real estate stock investments. Explore the future of real estate stock investment with our innovative tool, combining data analytics, machine learning, and blockchain technology for a holistic investment experience.

## Project Procedure

1. **Data Collection**
   - Gather historical financial data, including closing prices, for the past 5 years for the selected real estate stocks. This data is obtained from reliable sources or APIs such as Alpaca.

2. **Algorithmic Returns Calculation**
   - Implement machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression and Single Moving Averages, to calculate algorithmic returns for the chosen real estate stocks. The objective is to generate buy/sell signals that maximize accuracy, precision, and F1 score through the use of a confusion matrix.

3. **Portfolio Evaluation Metrics**
   - Compute a comprehensive set of portfolio evaluation metrics to assess the performance of each real estate stock. These metrics include:
     - Annualized return: A measure of the annual profit or loss percentage.
     - Cumulative returns: The overall returns over the investment period.
     - Annual volatility: A gauge of the investment's price fluctuations over a year.
     - Sharpe ratio: Evaluates the risk-adjusted return of the portfolio.
     - Sortino ratio: Assesses the return relative to downside risk, focusing on negative returns.

4. **Results Compilation**
   - Organize and compile the computed results into three separate CSV files, each representing an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). These CSV files serve as data sources for the dashboard.

5. **Dashboard Development**
   - Utilize Streamlit, Python, and the Web3 library to design and create an interactive dashboard. This dashboard should provide the following functionalities:
     - Selection of one of the three distinct Real Estate ETFs (Agriculture, Commercial, Housing).
     - Visualization of financial metrics and algorithmic returns using informative charts and graphs.
     - Integration of Crypto Wallets for both ETFs and investors, allowing seamless cryptocurrency transactions.
     - Input areas for investors to provide their personal details, including name, address, and contact number.
     - Enable users to buy/invest in the selected ETFs directly through the platform.
     - Implement validation mechanisms to confirm transactions and display the associated transaction hash.

6. **Prototype Testing**
   - Rigorously test the Streamlit app prototype to ensure its functionality and user-friendliness. Verify the app's performance by selecting different ETFs and completing cryptocurrency transactions.
